For the final technical task, I chose to send motor velocity command data
using the Twist message type in ROS2. In particular, I published forward speed(linear.x), 
and turning rate values(angular.z), which controls how fast a robot should move forward 
and how sharp its turns are. 
I made these values change over time so that the data would closley reflect controller 
output changing over time, for instance as a robot moves, rather than having unrealistic constant values. 
The subscriber node receives and prints this data so that one can verify that communication between nodes 
is working properly. 

In a robotics system, this type of data drives motion and navigation. 
A controller evaluates velocity commands 
based on sensor input and navigation target, then sends those commands to the motors. 
This allows the robot to move,turn, and follow routes. By completing this project, I know understand how ROS 2 handles communication and 
how control signals move through a robotic system.
